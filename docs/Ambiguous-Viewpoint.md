## Definition
Object-oriented analysis and design (OOA&D) models are often presented without clarifying the viewpoint represented by the model. By default, OOA&D models denote an implementation viewpoint that is potentially the least useful. Mixed viewpoints donâ€™t allow the fundamental separation of interfaces from implementation details, which is one of the primary benefits of the object-oriented paradigm.
